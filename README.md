# Vue MultiStep Form

Multistep form created with Vue 3 and Vite.

The purpose of this form is to use it as a ready made multistep form which
can be included in any website as needed, like using in wordpress or simple html page.

## Documentation
```bash


To use the form component i.e wordpress,html file 

include div with id of app as below

<div id="app">
</div>

and include the QuestionSlider component inside, 
its the multistep slider, add as below

<QuestionSlider>
      <template #slideItems>
      </template>
      </QuestionSlider>

After that step, now is a time to add slides
and for that I have used li tag  and inside it you can use
form input fields like [input[text],input[radio],input[checkbox],select] as below


<QuestionSlider>
      <template #slideItems>

        <li class="flex gap-4 flex-col">
            <input
              type="text"
              name="email"
              class="border border-black/30 rounded-md w-full px-4 py-2"
              required="required"
              errorMsg="Please fill the email field"
            />
            </li>

                   <li class="flex gap-4 flex-col">
            <input
              type="text"
              name="Firstname"
              class="border border-black/30 rounded-md w-full px-4 py-2"
              required="required"
              errorMsg="Please fill the email field"
            />
            </li>
      </template>
      </QuestionSlider>

You can customize error message via changing errorMsg attribute in 
input field
